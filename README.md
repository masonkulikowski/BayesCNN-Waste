# University of Delaware CISC 684 Final Project
This is the repository for a final project for the Introduction to Machine Learning course
at the University of Delaware. The purpose of this project is to compare the accuracy and effectiveness of a
Convolutional Neural Network and a Multi-Class Bayes Classifier.
The data comes from trashnet, a ~5000 image dataset of different pieces of trash and recycling that the models
will be using as training data for classification.

## Models

### Convolutional Neural Network

### Bayes Classifier

# Running the Models

## Prerequisites

[Miniconda](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/main) installed on your local machine,
runs project in a virtual environment.

## Commands

Create a virtual environment
```
conda env create -f environment.yml 
```
This will also install all necessary dependicies. 

Activate
```
conda activate bayescnn
```
